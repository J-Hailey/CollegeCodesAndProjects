<h1>Table Top Games Aren't That Bad</h1>
<p>I recently got into table-top games. Most 
notably Dungeons & Dragons and Open Legends. These 
two are Role Playing Games that I never thought I
would get into, but they are really fun. I started playing them 
with a group of friends on campus. They got me into Open Legends, 
which is like D&D but with a <i>twist</i>. I won't get 
into the details, but it's only slightly different with more 
identity towards character creation. This game my gateway into D&D 
which I play weekly with another group of friends on Discord.
