<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>
I have some pretty awesome hobbies 😄. I love to 
use digital art such as thumbnails, banners, 
and icons. I am obsessed with video games (<i>to a degree</i>), and 
I like to play a good table-top game every once in
a while. Lastly, going a on a walk is a healthy 
exsercise that I do periodically to keep the blood flowing. 
</p>
<h2>School life</h2>
<p>
School life is rough, but I don't regret one bit 🙃.
There have been plenty of great moments in my life that 
trump the bad moments. <b>Everyday</b> there's something new.
Never a dull moment at Austin Peay, yet the calm, boring 
moments are times where I can sit back and reflect. I 
sit back and think to myself, <i>"How did I get here?"</i>
</p>
<h2>Ambitions and Possible Future</h2>
<p>
My ambitions aren't as clouded as they used to be. 
I still have my dream of becoming a Software Engineer, but 
I got to get the ball rolling. There are still other career 
opportunites in Computer Science, that I want to experience 
in the future. For example, my experience with 
machine learning. I also want to travel to Los Angeles, and 
tell my cousin how much I've learned in Web Development (<i>after
I pass the class of course</i>).
