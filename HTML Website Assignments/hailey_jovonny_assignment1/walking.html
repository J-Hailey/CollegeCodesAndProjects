<h1>Walking keeps me healthy</h1>
<p> Every once in a while, I like to go on long walks 
through my neighborhood. This is something that is 
healthy for me to do. Not only physically, but mentally 
as well. When I have rough day, or if I just need to clear my head. 
It allows me to get away from not just reality, but the virtual world
as well. It's the healthiest way for me to get off the grid, even if it's
just for 30 minutes.
