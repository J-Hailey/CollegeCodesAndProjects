<h1>Digital Art is Awesome</h1>
<p>I love digital art. From the process, to sharing it, 
and eventually getting my hands dirty and doing it myself.
I use a program called <b>GIMP 2</b>, and it is free photo 
editing software similar to photoshop. I usually use it
to create YouTube Thumbnails for myself or for close friends.

<img src="wraith.png" alt="This is a picture of Wraith,
a character from Apex Legends.">
