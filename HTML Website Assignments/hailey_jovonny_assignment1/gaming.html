<h1>I love gaming (a little too much)</h1>
<p>Playing games turned from a fun pass-time into a huge part of my life.
During most of my high school years all I would when I came home was
play a video game. Today, I have scaled back <b>A LOT</b> and have 
gamed moderately ever since. Now I'm a full on PC gamer and I haven't looked
back. Playing on a PC is a great reminder when Microsoft Word is staring you
down menacingly. College is more important to me, than slaying a 
dragon (no matter how satisfying it is).
